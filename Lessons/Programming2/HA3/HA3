1. Handling Missing Data Questions:
How do you identify and handle missing values in a Pandas DataFrame?
To identify use use .isna() or .isnull()
To handle use .dropna() or .fillna() mean/median
What is imputation, and why might it be useful in dealing with missing data?
It is substituting missing values (mean, median, mode) for the missing data to prevent data loss.

2. Data Transformation Questions:
How can you encode categorical variables in a Pandas DataFrame?
pd.get_dummies() for one-hot encoding.
LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing for ordinal categories.
astype('category').cat.codes for quick numerical encoding.
What is one-hot encoding, and when would you use it in data preprocessing?
One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category. It is useful when dealing with non-ordinal categorical variables in machine learning models, especially for algorithms like linear regression or neural networks.

3. Removing Duplicates Questions:
How do you identify and remove duplicate rows from a DataFrame?
Use df.duplicated() to check for duplicates.
Use df.drop_duplicates() to remove them.
Can you explain the difference between the duplicated() and drop_duplicates() methods in Pandas?
duplicated() returns a Boolean Series indicating duplicated rows.
drop_duplicates() removes duplicate rows and returns a new DataFrame.
4. Data Scaling and Normalization Questions:
Discuss the importance of feature scaling in machine learning.
Feature Scaling helps to minimize the impact of outliers, thereby ensuring that no single feature dominates the others and has undue influence on the predictive model.
Explain the difference between min-max scaling and z-score normalization.
Min-max scaling scales data to fit within a specific range, usually between 0 and 1, while z-score normalization scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The key difference is that min-max scaling is sensitive to outliers while z-score normalization is not

5. Handling Outliers Questions:
What are outliers, and why might they impact machine learning models?
Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data, which can cause poor performance.
Describe different methods for detecting outliers in a dataset in Python
Use scatter plot, histogram, box-plot and z-score normalization
How can you handle outliers in a continuous numerical variable in Python?
Remove them using df[df['column'].between(lower_bound, upper_bound)].
Replace with median or mean.
